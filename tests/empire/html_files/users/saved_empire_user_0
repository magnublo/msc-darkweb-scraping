                <p style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">We became the biggest GHB vendor on WSM in just a few weeks. Before that, we were the fastest-growing GHB vendor on Dream, outselling others 3:1. We are now the fastest-growing vendor on Empire and #1 overall in sales over time.

All that is thanks to our product. We're the only ones who state concentration outright, do so accurately and have the highest achievable. It's the most potent GHB available on any market, domestic or otherwise. Check any vendor or market; you'll see nothing like the feedback below.

There's more about our product in our listings. The following is an explanation for people trying to understand why different vendors are claiming different concentrations, with theirs always the highest. Some even claim that impurities are deliberate and a sign of a superior product. Nothing could be further from the truth.

▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁
★  PURE GHB  ★
▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔
What is &quot;pure GHB?&quot; There seems to be a lot of misinformation going around on the internet (no surprise), and it's even worse on these markets where vendors try to pass off a degraded, poorly reacted, or deliberately adulterated product as superior. Let's clear all that up here, once and for all.

Before getting into details, here are the most common phrases &quot;wannabe chemists&quot; use to describe GHB. These are red flags, full stop:

&bull; Whatever's distributed INSIDE the solution is NEVER GHB, most commonly it's salt. GHB *can* precipitate, but only at the top.
&bull; Highly concentrated (&quot;double-jumbo-super high concentration&quot; is a red-flag, made-up word) NaGHB is evident by shaking and watching movement of air bubbles&mdash;the slower they move up, the higher the concentration.
&bull; 1,4-BDO is often misrepresented as GHB. An easy way to determine whether it's GHB is to use the air bubble test described above. It can also be tested by dropping a standard 3ml BD syringe, without a needle, as sold in most pharmacies, into the solution. If the syringe drops to the bottom, it's mostly water and a little BDO. It doesn't sink more than 0.5&quot; in a full bottle of our GHB.
&bull; GBL causes chemical burns on contact undiluted, and tastes bitter when diluted. The bitter taste can be covered up with salt, just like BDO. It also fails the air bubble test descirbed above.
&bull; GHB is never cloudy or &quot;white, lotion-like&quot;&mdash;it's a perfectly clear, highly viscous liquid. It's slightly more viscous than oil. The viscosity or thickness of GHB is what prevents the syringe from floating further down.
&bull; GHB is never a powder, nor evaporates to a powder&mdash;no chemical company sells it as a powder or a semi-solid paste. It forms crystals, only in a low humidity environment and only when poured out as a very thin layer.
&bull; A cloudy or &quot;white, lotion-like&quot; solution is contaminated by unreacted species. If the desired result was NaGHB, cloudiness is most likely NaCl, but may also be NaHCO3. If the desired result is hiding a different product like BDO or GBL, it's caused by a suspension of coarse sea salt to mask the bitter taste of that product.
(However, short of a GC/MS analysis, there is no way to tell what a cloudy is solution is contaminated by.)
&bull; Drying out (&quot;dehydrating&quot; is a red-flag, made-up word) a contaminated solution containing NaGHB will not yield the concentration of a pure product; it will yield the concentration of the contaminated solution. (For context, a &quot;dehydration reaction&quot; removes a hydrogen from a molecule, and is very different from evaporating a liquid.) Vendors like use fancy words to try to throw off unwitting customers.

The vendor using these phrases has mostly replaced them now. For example, &quot;super-saturated&quot; turned to &quot;double-jumbo-super high concentration&quot; and most recently to &quot;ultra concentrated.&quot; There's no such thing. Last we checked, &quot;cloudy&quot; was &quot;slightly white, lotion like,&quot; but, of course... that's the same thing, and the product is still cloudy.

It may be idealistic but we'd like to think that scams like won't work on this market. The vendors who do this often offer 3-4x free product with every complaint to ensure they get good feedback. Feedback can't be changed here, but customers tend to leave positive as a general rule for fear of repercussions. Reading through shady vendors' feedback, you'll find mainly lots of &quot;No feedback comment&quot; with scant references to a product &quot;so cloudy to where I don't know what it is.&quot;

A cloudy product is either poorly reacted with an excess of NaOH, or just coarse sea salt suspended in plain old water. Remember where you are - this is a dark web market where &quot;fraud&quot; is a category, and vendors will say and do anything to make money. VERY common in this community and on this market. Some recently changed their stated concentration from 0.8 g/mL to 0.9 g/mL to pretend they suddenly have a higher quality product.

If you find something where the ENTIRE solution is NOT viscous / thick / syrupy (even if the listing says it is, it will not be when you get it), but a large amount still gives GHB-like effects, it's a precursor/pro-drug or a mimetic to GHB. The most common of these is 1,4-BDO since it doesn't burn like GBL does, and is viscous unlike GBL. However, both are bitter, and since NaGHB is salty, the most common way of hiding the bitter taste is by adding salt to the solution. To make the salt not drop to the bottom like table salt, but disperse evenly throughout, coarse sea salt is used.

The most common way vendors try to tell customers they have a good product is to say to (a) add more water, dissolving the salt and (b) pour out the solution, leaving only salt behind. Drying out a bunch of salt in 1 mL of water to get .8g gives you just that--.8g of salt (now suddenly .9g.) Take it and you won't feel a thing, whereas with real GHB you most certainly will. This is a scam, it's not GHB.

Both 1,4-BDO and GBL have their own risks, ultimately resulting in coma and death by different mechanisms. BDO is initially biologically inactive but competes with alcohol dehydrogenase, so if a user has any alcohol in their system and continues to take more BDO because they're not feeling the effects of what they think is GHB, it builds up in the body until ethanol is fully metabolized. Then, it floods the bloodstream with GHB, leading to respiratory depression, coma and death.

This is the reason mixing real GHB with alcohol can be done in moderation, and each potentiates the effects of the other. On the other hand, mixing 1,4-BDO with alcohol is a recipe for a potentially fatal overdose. Never do it with other vendors' products.

Admittedly, putting BDO and salt together is a pretty clever way to trick people into dying. BDO turns into a white solid below room temperature... but salt lowers its freezing point, so it doesn't until much later. On the other hand, but real GHB in a freezer and watch it stay perfectly crystal clear. The only thing you might get is a precipitate at the very top of the entire solution.

GBL has an additional risk of metabolic acidosis by lowering the pH of the blood with regular and prolonged use, causing coma and death because the body can't maintain blood at pH 7.

Check these facts against any authoritative, reliable source. If you're looking at risks of BDO/GBL, we recommend clinical journals on PubMed, ScienceDirect or ResearchGate. For the properties of chemicals we recommend the MSDS from the WHO or any reputable chemical company.

Wherever you look, make sure there is a distinction between GHB and NaGHB, since the two have very different characteristics and properties. The max concentration of GHB in water may be 0.494 g/mL, but that's the FREE ACID which is not even stable in room temperature! That is NOT the max concentration of NaGHB in water, which is the stable ACID-BASE PAIRING, or salt of GHB.

The easiest way to tell whether you're looking at the right info is whether it refers to the free-acid GHB (gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid, or 4-hydroxybutanoic acid) or NaGHB: (gamma-hydroxybutyrate.) Only NaGHB is the real stuff.

Anyone directing you to information about GHB as a free-acid but pretending to sell NaGHB is too ignorant to know what they're supposed to be making and/or selling, or just selling something else like BDO/GBL altogether.

The vendor we love to hate (mostly because he's endangering people's lives for a quick buck) until recently claimed his GHB was made from &quot;ACS powder.&quot; What's ACS? American Chemical Society? The small chemical manufacturer in NJ without a website? After changing the listing countless times in response to what's written here, that vendor now says their GHB is made of Play-Doh.

A short explanation of what to expect from pure NaGHB:

#1: Concentration
▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔
We love competition, which is why we love to go toe-to-toe with others on points like this. We read a long-time Empire vendor's feedback that calls us out by name, says our product is good, but that we're lying about the concentration; that it couldn't possibly be over a certain number, in this case 0.5 g/mL because Xyrem, the big pharma product (also NaGHB) is that concentration, and it couldn't possibly be for convenience. All this, despite the vendor in whose feedback they're responding to advertising an 0.84 g/mL solution (if they could only do the math.)

Jazz Pharma's product is, in fact, concentrated at 0.5 g/mL for convenience. We link to their website in our product description, so we're aware of it. They dose it at 0.5 g/mL precisely because the max concentration NaGHB tops out below 1 g/mL in the liquid phase, and patients need to be able to measure it easily.

The pure NaGHB compound is most stable in its liquid state, since it has a lower freezing point and a higher boiling point than water. In this case, NaGHB will melt before it boils, and when it does, it polymerizes into the characteristic color of caramelized sugar, which forms a polyglucosaccharide at ~150 C.

Removing all the water leaves pure NaGHB a liquid in its normal state, even in the freezer, because of the lower freezing point. How pure, and therefore how concentrated, the solution is, depends on how tightly the parameters of the reaction process (we separate ours into multiple reactions for better control), and how well the the physical properties of the product are kept throughout the various stages, particularly with regard to thermodynamic regulation, as temperature spikes during each exothermic step.

We determine the concentration of each batch using a straightforwarrd mathematical formula. Multiplying the moles of one of our reagents by 3/2 and dividing by the total volume, once cooled and evaporated (a 2-3 day process), we normally get a result that that matches our desired concentration of 0.88-0.92 g/mL. Sometimes we get to 0.926 g/mL. If something had gone wrong during the reaction process, that batch does not get sold on the market, full stop.

#2: Solubility
▔▔▔▔▔▔
We've also read other vendors claiming that anyone's product with a concentration above some number is lying to you. Funny enough, the same vendor was called out in the same feedback mentioned previously as having the worst product on the market.

Pure NaGHB does not, ever, have anything floating in it. However, it's easy to lower the solubility of NaGHB by adding salt. During the reaction, this is typically done by adding HCl to NaOH to bring a very alkaline (pH &gt;&gt; 7) solution back to neutral; the two react to produce NaCl (table salt) and H2O/water. That salt floats freely and evenly throughout the solution, and becomes solvent when even more (!) water is added.

This is the worst possible scenario; salt should never be in the solution, despite some guides on the internet saying to use HCl to neutralize NaOH. An experienced chemist knows how to bring the pH back down without neutralizing using HCl. We'd consider that a failed reaction and toss the batch.

It is possible, with a lot of patience, to create a stable solution of pure NaGHB that precipitates out a portion into a semi-solid. However, that precipitate forms only on the top, never in the solution. At that point both the liquid portion and the semi-solid paste on top are both pure NaGHB, in different phases. They liquid is 0.9 g/mL and the paste is measured in grams.


#3: Physical properties
▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔
Pure NaGHB is never a &quot;powder&quot; nor a &quot;crystallized solid.&quot; If it's pure, crystals will only form in a thin layer, never a round semi-solid paste that looks like Play-Doh; those forms only occur if it's impure or polymerization has occured. As for powdered GHB, that just doesn't exist. No chemical company sells GHB in any form other than a liquid, which is its most stable form. However, depending on the source it can be impure.

We also use only BASF reagent at 99.95% purity sold by a German company named BASF. They are the only ones in the world that make GBL at that purity, and that product--our reagent--is the most expensive and highly regulated. Chinese GBL is sold as &quot;99% pure&quot; and known to contain up to 5% heavy metals. Heavy metal poisoning, besides the immediate symptoms you can search, accumulates in the body throughout one's lifetime, leading to diseases like dementia, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.

The purity of GBL can be determined with an EC (electric conductivity) meter by measuring the TDS (total dissolved solids) in the solution. Chinese GBL reads 94-96% purity, whereas BASF is always 100%, based on the % tolerance of the EC meter and the estimation of TDS by EC.

It's very difficult to bring that back into solution because of the strength of the bonds that have now formed between adjacent molecules. Dissolving that reaction product in water below NaGHB's melting temperature is only possible by scraping powder off the solid block, but because it's now polymerized, its solubility and bioavailability are much lower.

To bind to the GHB and GABA-B subtype receptors, GHB has to fit into the receptor site; as a polymer, only one end of each polymer can make that binding; the rest floats along with the bound molecule in the synaptic cleft; eventually, the entire chain is metabolized. Since it's a polymer, it's first broken down by a depolymerase and then a dehydrogenase (specifically, 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase) that metablizes free GHB.

The whole point of producing NaGHB is to get it to its maximum stable liquid concentration. We avoid the polymerization, which is why ours, as the feedback says, is stronger without the saltier taste. Nothing should be free-floating (that's a salt) and the solution is ideally a crystal clear, viscous solution that when shaken creates hundreds of tiny, slowly-moving air bubbles. That's what you get with our product.

It's okay, but not ideal, to have a thin layer of semi-solid precipitate, but only at the top, that disappears when the solution is shaken. Shaking and heating both increase entropy, and bring all the NaGHB back into the liquid phase and into solution temporarily; leaving it in room temp will form the same precipitate (again, only at the top) within minutes.

Outside of that, pure GHB never needs to be shaken since it contains no salt, water or other impurities to move around. You'll get hundreds of air bubbles from the rest of the bottle, but that's it. The slower they move up, the higher concentration your G is.

You can also test whether it's GHB at all by dropping a standard 3cc syringe into GHB; it won't sink more than half an inch in a full, standard 50 mL bottle with a nearly 1&quot; diameter all the way across, due to the viscosity of GHB as opposed to 1,4-BDO or GBL.

★ DOSING ★
▔▔▔▔▔▔
Use a syringe or our caps to measure out the desired amount. Filled to the very top, our clear caps are 3 mL. For precise measurement, though, use a 3 cc or 1 cc syringe (1 cc = 1 mL, and a needle is not needed) to measure out the desired amount. These are available on any clear net marketplace and many pharmacies stock them behind the counter. You can also use a 0.5 cc insulin syringe, available in all pharmacies.

The dose-response curve for GHB isn't linear; a linear approximation is 1.1 mL per 60 lbs of body weight. Our recommendation is to start with 3.3 mL for males and 2.2 mL for females, based on 180 lbs for males and 120 lbs for females. It's a safe &quot;starter dose&quot; that you may or may not feel the first go-around. See below for info on how much to increase per dose until you find YOURS!

Take GHB on an EMPTY STOMACH for highest absorption. Taking it after a meal reduces effects by over 60%. Refer to the following link if you are unfamiliar with G metabolism. This is the same substance, dosed at half what ours is at 200x the price. Thanks for the graph, big pharma:

As it shows, peak effects are at 50 min on an empty stomach and 90 min with food. ━★ PEAK EFFECTS ★━ can best be described as pure euphoria without a rush; GHB is a naturally occurring neurotransmitter in the brain responsible for GABA regulation. Without going into excess, it seems to make everything more pleasant and calm. The effect on sociability is what is most pronounced for anyone who's ever tried Xanax, Klonopin or even alcohol. It's an approved treatment in Italy and Austria for alcohol dependence.

Please wait until that 50-90 min length of time until redosing, or you can get tired, fall asleep, and even pass out. As with any chemical, it is possible to overdose, especially if you are careless. That said, the ED50/LD50 curves for G are closer than most substances.

After the effect has worn off you can increase the amount by 0.5 mL on your next dose. The prescribing guidelines at the link above say the range goes up to 4.5 g (5 mL of our product) per dose.

If you've been drinking, don't take it at all, until you're at least 10 &quot;peak effect&quot; experiences in. With real GHB you can drink safely; however, vendors on this market do sell precursors that will cause serious and potentially lethal outcomes when combined with GHB. Read our profile for more on this; it happens with 1,4-BDO since in the competitive inhibition of the dehydrogenase enzyme that prevents the conversion to GHB, alcohol is the preferred ligand, and once it's gone suddenly all that BDO gets converted at once.

Never drive on G, you'll be very distracted and a danger to others.</p>
